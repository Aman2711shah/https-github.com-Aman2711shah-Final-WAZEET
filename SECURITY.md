# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and recommend using the latest version of WAZEET. The following table shows which versions of our project are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them using one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send an email to the project maintainers (create a private security advisory if email is not available)
   
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's Security Advisory feature:
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include as much of the following information as possible:

* **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
* **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* **Any special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
* **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
* **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
* **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

* **Initial Response**: You should receive an initial response within 48 hours acknowledging your report
* **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress towards a fix and announcement
* **Credit**: We will give credit to the reporter (unless they wish to remain anonymous)
* **Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 90 days

## Security Best Practices for Users

### General Recommendations

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of WAZEET
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines in the documentation
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, connection strings) to the repository
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
6. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms
7. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
8. **Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging but never log sensitive information

### For .NET Applications

```csharp
// Use secure configuration
builder.Services.AddDataProtection()
    .PersistKeysToFileSystem(new DirectoryInfo(@"./keys/"))
    .ProtectKeysWithDpapi();

// Enable HTTPS redirection
app.UseHttpsRedirection();

// Use secure headers
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block");
    context.Response.Headers.Add("Referrer-Policy", "strict-origin-when-cross-origin");
    await next();
});
```

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive data:

```bash
# .env file (NEVER commit this!)
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
API_KEY=your_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Load in application:

```csharp
var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING");
```

### Password Storage

Always hash passwords using industry-standard algorithms:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;

// Use Identity framework for password hashing
var hasher = new PasswordHasher<User>();
var hashedPassword = hasher.HashPassword(user, password);
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

Always use parameterized queries:

```csharp
// Good - Parameterized
var user = await context.Users
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(u => u.Username == username);

// Bad - String concatenation
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = '{username}'"; // NEVER DO THIS!
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

```csharp
// Razor automatically encodes output
<p>@Model.UserInput</p> // Safe

// For raw HTML (use with caution)
@Html.Raw(sanitizedHtml) // Only use with properly sanitized content
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

```csharp
// Add anti-forgery tokens
builder.Services.AddAntiforgery();

// In Razor pages/views
<form method="post">
    @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

## Security Scanning

### Recommended Tools

1. **OWASP Dependency-Check** - Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **SonarQube** - Static code analysis
3. **GitHub Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates
4. **Snyk** - Security scanning for code and dependencies
5. **dotnet list package --vulnerable** - Check for vulnerable NuGet packages

### Run Security Scan

```bash
# Check for vulnerable packages
dotnet list package --vulnerable --include-transitive

# Update packages
dotnet restore
dotnet outdated
```

## Security Checklist for Developers

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures in place
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Logging doesn't capture sensitive data
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Security scan completed with no critical issues

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens should have reasonable expiration times
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Use secure token storage on client side

### Authorization
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Validate authorization on every request
- Don't rely solely on client-side authorization

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS for data in transit
- Implement proper backup encryption

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private disclosure** to maintainers first
2. **Patch development** and testing
3. **Security advisory** published
4. **Public disclosure** after patch is available
5. **Credit** given to reporter (if desired)

## Security Updates

Security updates will be announced through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Repository README
- Release notes

Subscribe to repository notifications to stay informed.
