## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what behavior you expected
- **Include screenshots** if applicable
- **Note your environment** (OS, .NET version, Visual Studio version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
- **List any alternative solutions** you've considered

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Issues that should only require a few lines of code
- `help wanted` - Issues that may be a bit more involved

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Follow the [style guidelines](#style-guidelines)
- Include appropriate test cases
- Update documentation as needed
- End all files with a newline

## üé® Style Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- **Write clear, readable code** - Code is read more often than it's written
- **Keep it simple** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Comment your code** - Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style of existing code

### .NET/C# Specific Guidelines

- Follow [Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and small (ideally under 30 lines)
- Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Write XML documentation comments for public APIs

### Code Formatting

```csharp
// Good example
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(userRepository));
    }

    public async Task<User> GetUserByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        if (id <= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("User ID must be positive", nameof(id));
        }

        return await _userRepository.GetByIdAsync(id);
    }
}
```

## üìù Commit Messages

Good commit messages are important for maintaining a clear project history.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect the code's meaning (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add user authentication system

Implement JWT-based authentication with login and logout functionality.
Includes password hashing and token validation.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): handle null reference in user endpoint

Add null check before accessing user properties to prevent
NullReferenceException.

Fixes #456
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Ensure README.md and other docs reflect your changes
2. **Update the changelog** - Add your changes to CHANGELOG.md (if it exists)
3. **Test your changes** - Ensure all tests pass and add new tests as needed
4. **Request review** - Tag appropriate reviewers
5. **Address feedback** - Make changes requested by reviewers
6. **Squash commits** - Consider squashing commits before merging for a cleaner history

### PR Checklist

## üéØ Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent production fixes

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestName"
```

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Ask questions rather than make demands
- Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
- Praise good practices
- Explain the reasoning behind your suggestions
